#### By Zach Wissner-Gross

To celebrate the new year, here’s a quick puzzle about the number 2020. Of all the fractions out there that are greater than 1/2020 but less than 1/2019, one has the smallest denominator. Which fraction is it?

(Before you ask, by “fraction” I mean that both the numerator and denominator should be whole numbers.)

## My Solution

```{r}
for (den in 1:10000) {
  for (num in 1:den) {
    if (((num/den) < (1/2019)) && ((num/den) > (1/2020))) {
      print(paste(num,"/",den))
    }
  }
}
```
